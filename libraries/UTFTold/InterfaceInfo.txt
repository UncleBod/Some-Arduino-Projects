This looks like a kind of pin-mapping for the connection of the TFT.
As i saw in the datasheet you need 2 power sources ?, and the whole thing is driven bei SPI.

    SDO: Serial clock output
    LED: 3.4V Power Supply pin
    SCL: Serial clock input
    SDA / SDI: Serial data input
    DC: Data / Command selection
    RST: Reset, Low level active
    CS: Chip Selection, Low level active
    GND: Ground
    VDD33: 3.3V Power Supply pin
    UTFT Support



GND & Vcc is for the circuit, LED is power for led.

Did you connect RESET and is this HIGH or LOW ?
