Some-Arduino-Projects
=====================
Some projects that hopefully will end in a weatherstation.
First part will be some test sketches and changes in the used libraries so they will work together.

Hygrometer/Thermometer up and running

Working on storing mx/min values in EEPRom.

SD card installed and it seems I'm getting the hang of it.
I had some problem with corrupt file earlier, but am working on it.

ToDo list (not in any order):
Graphics
Buttons
RTC
One more sensor
