Some-Arduino-Projects
=====================
Some projects that hopefully will end in a weatherstation.
First part will be some test sketches and changes in the used libraries so they will work together.

Hygrometer/Thermometer up and running

Working on storing mx/min values in EEPRom.

ToDo list (not in any order):
Graphics
Buttons
RTC
SD card
One more sensor
